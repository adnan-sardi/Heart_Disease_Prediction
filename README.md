# Heart_Disease_Prediction

## Brainnest Training Program

This project documents my traineeship experience with [Brainnest](https://www.linkedin.com/company/brainnest-consulting/), where I was able to expand my data analysis skills by working with a real-world dataset on heart disease. By exploring and modeling the dataset, I gained a deeper understanding of the risk factors associated with heart disease, as well as the potential for early detection and prevention.

Through the course of the project, I utilized a variety of statistical tools and techniques, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and visualization. I also utilized popular Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn to help streamline my analysis and visualization processes.

The resulting repository provides detailed documentation of my analysis approach, including the methods and techniques I used to preprocess and clean the data, identify important features, and train and evaluate various machine learning models. I also provide visualizations that help convey the key insights and findings from my analysis.

Overall, this traineeship experience allowed me to develop and showcase my skills in data analysis and machine learning, and provided valuable insights into the world of healthcare and the potential for data-driven approaches to improve patient outcomes."
